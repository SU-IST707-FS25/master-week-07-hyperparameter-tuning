Former-President Trump on Thursday denied a report that claimed he regularly clogged White House toilets by attempting to flush documents down the can. 

"Another fake story, that I flushed papers and documents down a White House toilet, is categorically untrue and simply made up by a reporter in order to get publicity for a mostly fictitious book," Trump said in a statement. 

CNN spent much of the morning covering "breaking news" about Trump’s White House toilet, which came from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman's forthcoming book. Haberman is also a CNN political analyst.

"We are beginning with breaking news. Staff members at the White House residence discovered wads of printed paper in a clogged toilet on more than one occasion during the Trump administration and believe that it was the former president himself who was trying to flush documents," CNN’s Brianna Keilar said to open the 8 a.m. hour of "New Day."

CNN covered the "breaking news" several times throughout the morning, bringing on Haberman and others to break down the significance of Trump’s reported plumbing issues. 

"I learned that staff in the White House residence would periodicaly find the toilet clogged, the engineer would have to come and fix it and what the engineer would generally find would be wads of, you know, wet, printed paper … Meaning it was not toilet paper, this was either notes or some other piece of paper that they believed he had thrown down the toilet," Haberman told CNN viewers. 

"What it could be, Brianna, could be anybody’s guess. It could be post-its, it could be notes to himself, it could be other things," Haberman added. "It certainly does add, as you said another dimension to what we know about how he handled material in the White House." 

At one point, CNN anchor John Berman pressed Haberman on whether the alleged plumbing issues occurred in Trump’s personal toilet. 

"His toilet? Like no mistaking, whose toilet it was?" Berman asked. 

"It was in the pipes," Haberman answered. "This was his bathroom." 

Trump quickly denied the allegation, chalking it up as "another fake story." 

"The Democrats are just using this and the Unselect Committee of political hacks as a camouflage for how horribly our Country is doing under the Biden Administration," Trump said.

In the grand scheme of things, Donald Trump has bigger problems to deal with than 15 boxes of papers.

Or his toilet practices.

After all, the former president is under investigation in Washington, New York and Georgia for allegations ranging from improperly pressuring officials to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory to possible fraud at the Trump Organization. He is in a war of words with Mitch McConnell, who accuses him of inciting the Capitol "insurrection," and is accusing Mike Pence of failing in his duty to "overturn the election." He is backing the RNC’s censure of Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for helping probe "legitimate political discourse" on Jan. 6. And he is trying to elect like-minded Republicans in the midterms and defeat critics he dismisses as RINOs.

But it’s more serious than that, and throws a very harsh spotlight on hypocrisy in the political and media world.

Trump has now turned over to the National Archives the papers he took to Mar-a-Lago, said to include his correspondence with Kim Jong-un and the famous hurricane map he altered with a Sharpie to buttress his argument with federal weather forecasters.

But The New York Times reported Thursday that the Archives has "discovered what it believed was classified information in documents Donald J. Trump had taken with him from the White House as he left office," according to an unnamed source.

And The Washington Post reports that Archives officials have referred the matter to the Justice Department.

Now this touches a nerve because Trump used the handling of government documents as a major issue against Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was a legitimate story that she used a private email server as secretary of state, questions were raised about whether she transmitted some classified documents, and she handled it horribly by taking weeks to apologize.

Candidate Trump pounded away ("Russia, if you’re listening…) at the Democratic candidate for deleting 33,000 emails she said were personal. All this was heavily covered by the press – Hillary’s defenders said way overcovered – especially when Jim Comey reopened the FBI’s investigation at the tail end of the campaign.

But now you have Republicans and conservative media outlets that went utterly haywire over Hillary’s emails largely silent over Trump spiriting away government documents that one report says included classified material.

And you have Democrats and liberal media outlets infuriated about Trump’s Mar-a-Lago stash who insisted that the Clinton story was overblown and she did nothing wrong. Selective outrage is Washington’s ethos.

Trump said in a statement: "The papers were given easily and without conflict and on a very friendly basis, which is different from the accounts being drawn up by the Fake News Media. In fact, it was viewed as routine and ‘no big deal.’"

The bigness of the deal remains to be seen, but these papers were never supposed to leave the White House.

Back in 2005, Sandy Berger, Bill Clinton’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of secretly taking home classified documents from the National Archives. He was fined $50,000 and sentenced to two years of probation and 100 hours of community service. And that was treated as a very big story.

Meanwhile, Axios reported Thursday on a story from a forthcoming book by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman. In "Confidence Man," she says, staffers in the White House residence sometimes discovered wads of paper clogging a toilet, and that they believed the president had flushed down these scraps. Not exactly the most foolproof method, to be sure. Earlier reports say Trump occasionally ripped up White House documents and aides had to tape them back together to hand over to the Archives.

In his statement, Trump described that as "another fake story, that I flushed papers and documents down a White House toilet, is categorically untrue and simply made up by a reporter in order to get publicity for a mostly fictitious book."

Left unmentioned: Trump has granted Haberman, who covered him for years in New York before he got into politics, several interviews for the book.

Now of course Haberman, who discussed the scoop on CNN, is trying to drum up some attention for a book that comes out this fall. But it’s not clear how Trump has divined that the unfinished book is "mostly fictitious," since no one has seen it yet.

Hillary Clinton's spokesman knocked The New York Times for not including her statement in a report on the controversy surrounding former President Trump's handling of government records. 

The Times ran a report Thursday pointing out how Republicans have so far been "quiet" about the 45th president allegedly keeping classified documents at his residence in Mar-a-Lago in violation of the National Archives and Records Administration policy. 

The revelations of Trump's handling of records have sparked comparisons to the email scandal that dogged Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign after it was discovered that she kept a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. The Times pointed out Republicans, including Trump, were quite outspoken about the email controversy. 

Nick Merrill, a longtime aide to Clinton, took to Twitter on Friday and called out the Times for omitting the statement he had provided on behalf of the former first lady. 

"The @nytimes just printed a story on Trump’s mishandling of classified information. They asked for comment from @HillaryClinton’s office as this exposes his hypocrisy. In typical form, the NYT’s editors declined to print the comment, so posting it here," Merrill tweeted. 

He then shared the statement, which read, "The 2-year frenzy over emails was a political Rorschach test, where everyone saw everything different in what was ultimately nothing. Call it sexism, Republican depravity, ratings-hungry media, it's time we acknowledge it was bulls---, and write that into the history books."

Still, Clinton is capitalizing off of Trump's negative headlines by selling hats that read, "But her emails," mocking the uproar over the private email server. 

Notably, it was the New York Times that first broke the story about Clinton's email server. The Times did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. 

Trump, meanwhile, denied claims reported by New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman in her forthcoming book that he would regularly clog White House toilets with documents. 

"Another fake story, that I flushed papers and documents down a White House toilet, is categorically untrue and simply made up by a reporter in order to get publicity for a mostly fictitious book," Trump said in a statement. 

"I learned that staff in the White House residence would periodically find the toilet clogged,"  Haberman said on CNN. "The engineer would have to come and fix it, and what the engineer would generally find would be wads of, you know, wet, printed paper … Meaning it was not toilet paper. This was either notes or some other piece of paper that they believed he had thrown down the toilet."

The National Archives and Records Administration says former President Trump took "classified national security information" to his personal residence at Mar-a-Lago.

In a letter sent to Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.,  David Ferriero, archivist of the United States, wrote that some information in the 15 boxes of presidential records taken to President Trump's personal residence in Florida contained "classified national security information."

"I write in response to your letter of February 9, 2022, in which you asked a number of questions relating to "the 15 boxes of presidential records that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) recently recovered from former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence," Ferriero wrote to Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., in a letter dated Friday. "Please see our responses to each of your questions."

Maloney is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

The fourth question addressed in the letter asked, "Are the contents of the boxes of records recovered by NARA undergoing a review to determine if they contain classified information? If so, who is conducting that review and has any classified information been found?" 

Ferriero responded by stating, "NARA has identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes." 

In a statement, former President Trump said that the National Archives didn't "find" the documents, and that they were given upon request.

"The National Archives did not ‘find’ anything, they were given, upon request, Presidential Records in an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act," Trump said.

Trump added that the Democrats "are in search of their next Scam."

"The Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax turned out to be a Democrat inspired fake story to help Crooked Hillary Clinton. Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, and so much more, has all been a Hoax. The Fake News is making it seem like me, as the President of the United States, was working in a filing room. No, I was busy destroying ISIS, building the greatest economy America had ever seen, brokering Peace deals, making sure Russia didn’t attack Ukraine, making sure China didn’t take over Taiwan, making sure there was no inflation, creating an energy independent country, rebuilding our military and law enforcement, saving our Second Amendment, protecting our Border, and cutting taxes. Now, Russia is invading Ukraine, our economy is being destroyed, our Border is once again overrun, and the mandate continues. Instead of focusing on America, the media just wants to talk about their plan to ‘get’ Trump. The people won’t stand for it any longer!," Trump said.

Former President Trump was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury Thursday after a years-long investigation led by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. 

The former president of the United States and the leading Republican candidate for the White House in 2024 was charged Thursday, after weeks of speculation on whether Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg would seek to indict him related to hush money payments made before the 2016 presidential election. 

Trump's presidency was clouded by investigations — several probed whether he colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, some focused on his finances, and others led to impeachment, making him the first president in United States history to have been impeached twice.

Trump’s post-presidential life is reminiscent of his days in the Oval Office, marred by probes which the former president and his allies say are all just part of an effort by his political opponents to derail his 2024 presidential campaign.

Trump was indicted on March 30, 2023 after the Manhattan District Attorney's Office's years-long investigation, possibly for hush money payments. 

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been investigating Trump for hush money payments made leading up to the 2016 presidential election. 

These include the $130,000 payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, and the $150,000 payment made to former Playboy model Karen McDougal. 

Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York opted out of charging Trump related to the Stormy Daniels payment in 2019, even as Cohen implicated him as part of his plea deal. The Federal Election Commission also tossed its investigation into the matter in 2021.

The charges stem from the $130,000 hush money payment then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. 

Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison in 2018 after pleading guilty to federal charges, including tax evasion, lying to Congress, and campaign finance violations. Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging payments to Daniels and model Karen McDougal to prevent them from going public with alleged affairs with Trump, which Trump has repeatedly denied. 

Cohen said Trump directed those payments. Federal prosecutors opted out of charging Trump related to the Stormy Daniels payment in 2018, even as Cohen implicated him as part of his plea deal.

Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 through his own company and was later reimbursed by Trump's company, which logged the payments as "legal expenses." McDougal received $150,000 through the publisher of the supermarket tabloid the National Enquirer.

The Trump Organization "grossed up" Cohen’s reimbursement for Daniels' payment for "tax purposes," according to federal prosecutors who filed the 2018 criminal charges against Cohen for the payments. 

Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing with regard to the payments made to Daniels, and has repeatedly said the payments were "not a campaign violation," but rather a "simple private transaction." 

The Federal Election Commission in 2021 tossed its investigation into the matter.

The line of inquiry and potential charges come as part of an investigation opened in 2019 by then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. The probe was focused on possible bank, insurance and tax fraud. The case initially involved financial dealings of Trump’s Manhattan properties, including his flagship Fifth Avenue building, Trump Tower, and the valuation of his 213-acre estate Seven Springs in Westchester.

The investigation last year led to tax fraud charges against The Trump Organization, and its finance chief Allen Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty.

Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith, a DOJ official, as special counsel to investigate Trump's alleged improper retention of classified records from his presidency at his Mar-a-Lago home. 

Smith has also taken over the Justice Department’s investigation into the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021—specifically whether Trump or other officials and entities interfered with the peaceful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election, including the certification of the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6, 2021.

President Biden is also currently under special counsel investigation for his alleged improper retention of classified records from the Obama administration. Former Vice President Pence also had classified records at his home—a matter under review by the Justice Department. 

The appointment of a special counsel in the matter comes after the FBI, in August, in an unprecedented move, raided Trump’s private residence at Mar-a-Lago in connection with an investigation into classified records the former president allegedly took with him from the White House.

The raid was related to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which said earlier this year that Trump took 15 boxes of presidential records to his personal residence in Florida. Those boxes allegedly contained "classified national security information," and official correspondence between Trump and foreign heads of state.

The NARA notified Congress in February that the agency recovered the 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago and "identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes." The matter was referred to the Justice Department by NARA.

Trump, earlier this year, said the National Archives did not "find" the documents, but that they were "given, upon request." Sources close to the former president said he had been cooperating and there was "no need" for the raid.

Classified material that was reportedly confiscated by the FBI during the raid Monday included a letter to Trump from former President Obama, a letter from Kim Jong Un, a birthday dinner menu and a cocktail napkin.

Last year, a federal appeals court paved the way for the House Ways and Means Committee to finally obtain Trump’s tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service—something the panel had been trying to obtain since 2019, under a law that permits the disclosure of an individual's tax returns to the congressional committee.

Trump sought emergency intervention measures from the Supreme Court in an attempt to temporarily block any release of these tax records, but was denied. 

Democrats, in December 2022, released a report on Trump's tax returns. 

The committee claimed that the IRS failed to audit Trump effectively while he was in office. However, there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump administration and the IRS, nor are there any records of the former president pushing back against reviews of his tax information.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, has been investigating Trump since she took office in January 2019. James brought a lawsuit against Trump in September alleging he and his company misled banks and others about the value of his assets.

James’ claimed that Trump and his children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, as well as his associates and businesses, allegedly committed "numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation" regarding financial statements.

James alleged Trump "inflated his net worth by billions of dollars" and said his children helped him to do so.

Over the summer, Trump appeared in downtown New York City for his deposition before New York Attorney General Letitia James. James’ office has been conducting a civil investigation into the Trump Organization to find out whether Trump and his company improperly inflated the value of assets on financial statements in order to obtain loans and tax benefits. 

"I did nothing wrong, which is why, after five years of looking, the Federal, State and local governments, together with the Fake News Media, have found nothing," Trump said in a statement in August. 

"The United States Constitution exists for this very purpose, and I will utilize it to the fullest extent to defend myself against this malicious attack by this administration, this Attorney General’s Office, and all other attacks on my family, my business, and our Country."

"I once asked, ‘If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?’ Now I know the answer to that question," he continued. "When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the Fake News Media, you have no choice." 

"If there was any question in my mind, the raid of my home, Mar-a-Lago, on Monday by the FBI, just two days prior to this deposition, wiped out any uncertainty," Trump said. "I have absolutely no choice because the current Administration and many prosecutors in this Country have lost all moral and ethical bounds of decency."

Trump added: "Accordingly, under the advice of my counsel and for all of the above reasons, I declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution."

A spokesperson for the New York State Attorney General’s Office confirmed that the office conducted Trump’s deposition.

"Attorney General Letitia James took part in the deposition during which Mr. Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination," the spokesperson said. "Attorney General James will pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead."

When Trump took office in January 2017, the FBI was in the middle of conducting a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Donald Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 election. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as "Crossfire Hurricane," and began on July 31, 2016.

That investigation was opened, despite then-CIA Director John Brennan briefing then-President Obama on July 28, 2016 about a purported proposal from one of Hillary Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers "to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service."

In September 2016, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to then-FBI Director James Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: "Crossfire Hurricane."

Fox News first obtained and reported on the CIOL, which stated: "The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate."

"An exchange [REDACTED] discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server," the referral states.

It is unclear how the FBI handled that memo.

Special Counsel John Durham is currently investigating the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia probe. 

After Trump’s victory and during the presidential transition period, Comey briefed Trump on the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier, containing salacious allegations of purported coordination between Trump and the Russian government. It was authored by Christopher Steele, an ex-British intelligence officer.

The DOJ inspector general later revealed that the unverified dossier helped serve as the basis for controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants obtained against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. 

It is now widely known that Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded the dossier through the law firm Perkins Coie.

During the early months of Trump’s administration, Jeff Sessions, who served as attorney general at the time, recused himself from oversight of the FBI’s Russia investigation, due to his involvement with the Trump campaign, per Justice Department regulations. Then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was then tasked with oversight of the investigation.

Trump, in May 2017, fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Comey, during his June 2017 testimony to Congress, said he deliberately leaked a memo from a key meeting with Trump to a friend after he was fired in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

"I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter—I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel," Comey testified.

Days after Comey was fired, Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to take over the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe.

The Mueller investigation clouded the Trump administration for nearly two years.

Simultaneously, investigations into Trump-Russia allegations were launched on Capitol Hill—in both chambers of Congress.

The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Intelligence Committee opened investigations into whether Trump and members of his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential race. 

Neither the House nor Senate investigation found evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia. 

After nearly two years, Mueller’s investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.

Mueller, though, did not draw a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice. At the time, then-Attorney General Bill Barr and Rosenstein concluded the evidence from the Mueller case was "not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."

Once Mueller’s findings were made public, congressional Democrats seized on the issue of obstruction of justice, and began ramping up investigations on matters that spanned from Trump’s personal finances to security clearances for Trump administration officials, all whilst the drumbeat of impeachment built within the House Democratic caucus.
