1. What is the difference between a hyperparameter and a parameter?
2. What role does a loss function play in an optimizer?
3. What are the relative merits of GridSearch vs. RandomSearch?
4. How does BayesianParameter optimization work?
5. What does using an initial random search with Hyperopt accomplish?
6. What is "multi-objective" optimization?
7. How is coherence calculated when used in clustering?
8. What sorts of clusters does coherence prefer?
9. Can you think of a way to adapt coherence so that it works well with non-convex clusters?
10. Why do we weight larger clusters more heavily when optimizing for coherence?
11. If you have a huge parameter space and limited compute available, what optimization procedure would you prefer?
